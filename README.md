# Hello-world
Hello, I'm Steve.I study at Athens University of Economics and Business(Department of Informatics). 
Currently i am a microsoft student partner and that because I'm a big tech geek that loves not only writing code, but also talking about writing code.
In the future i want to become a game developer, and my dream is to work for Blizzard Entertainment
